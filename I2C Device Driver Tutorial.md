The **Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C)** protocol is a popular serial communication protocol used for connecting low-speed peripherals to microcontrollers and embedded systems. In this multi-part tutorial series, we'll explore how to develop an I2C device driver in the Linux kernel. In this first part, we'll introduce the basics of the I2C protocol, discuss its key features, and lay the foundation for developing an I2C device driver.

**Introduction to I2C Protocol:-**
The I2C protocol, developed by Philips Semiconductor (now NXP Semiconductors), enables communication between integrated circuits using only two wires: a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL).I2C supports multiple devices connected to the same bus, each with a unique 7-bit address.
It offers advantages such as simplicity, low pin count, and bidirectional communication, making it suitable for connecting sensors, EEPROMs, RTCs, and other peripheral devices.

**Understanding I2C Device Architecture:**
- An I2C device typically consists of one or more registers accessible through the I2C bus.
- Each device has a unique 7-bit address that identifies it on the I2C bus. Some devices may have multiple addresses for different functionalities.
- Communication with an I2C device involves sending commands or data to specific registers and reading or writing their contents.
- I2C devices may support different data transfer protocols, such as byte-wise, block-wise, or combined read/write operations.
